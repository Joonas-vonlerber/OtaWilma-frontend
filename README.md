## Share courses with your friends
#### Let's be real, we all want to share the same courses with our friends. However, the plans have a tendency to change, and it's too foten you have to ask your friends to show you their selections
#### With Otawilma's friend-code system, you are able to generate one-time usable 'friend-codes'. which allow you to see your friend's latest selections. With no limit to the number of friends you can share the courses with, you and your friend-group will be able to sync your selections without any issues.
